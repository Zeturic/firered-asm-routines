## BW2 Repel System

BW2 introduced a feature where, after a repel runs out, if you still have more Repels in your bag, the game will ask if you want to use another. [Darthatron](https://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=20926) ported this to Fire Red and [posted it to Pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=7394253&postcount=1).

### Installation

Nothing unusual here. Aside from the filenames of your ROM and where you want the code to be inserted, there's nothing to configure. And then just run `/path/to/armips trainerface.asm`.
