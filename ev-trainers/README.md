## Trainers with EVs

This is [DoesntKnowHowToPlay](https://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=300067)'s hack that allows you to assign EVs to NPC trainer's Pok√©mon, originally posted [here](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=7795831&postcount=1).

### Installation

Nothing unusual here. Aside from the filenames of your ROM and where you want the code to be inserted, there's nothing to configure. And then just run `/path/to/armips ev-trainers/main.asm`.

This doesn't insert the table of EV spreads (`EV_Table`). You'll need to add that manually.
